For the last year I was trying "to find myself". I just fell in love with algorithms and coding. Now I'm trying to become frontend developer. I had worked for 2 years as engineer and I didn't enjoy it. I just want to do things that I like and make some money for living.  
Basic JavaScript, HTML, CSS. My favorite framework is Vanilla JS.
